## Unlock Secret Files

For security reasons, some files are kept secret with git-crypt. To unlock these files, you must download git-crypt. For example, if you are on OSX, you may run `brew install git-crypt`. Then, you may clone the repo and unlock the files with the provided key file by running `git-crypt unlock <path to key>`.
